The goal of Soft-Warehouse is to provide a website which contains a constantly growing location of all different types of software
for easier access and availability to the user. We will provide a different variety of software, most of which is free, some
of which may be purchased, with the simple click of a button, whether it be a redirection link, or a download page. While some of the
software may be created by our team, users and software creaters are encouraged to email our team to request to
add their own software for public sharing so that others may benefit from it too.

All files were created using .aspx and .css files.
